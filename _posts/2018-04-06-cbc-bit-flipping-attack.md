### **What is Encryption?**

Simply, encryption is the act of transforming data into unreadable format 



### **Encryption vs Hashing vs Encoding**

**Hashing:** Performing certain arithmetic operations on a piece of data to extract a hash value. This method is used to preserve the integrity of the data.
**Encoding:** Changing the way data is represented
